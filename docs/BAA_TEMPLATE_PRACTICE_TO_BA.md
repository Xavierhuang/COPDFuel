2.2 Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI for marketing, advertising, or sale; or for any purpose other than as set forth in this Agreement or as required by law.

2.3 The services covered by this Agreement are: operation of the COPD Health Tracker application, including storage and transmission of health data that patients have consented to share with Covered Entity, and making that data available to authorized users of Covered Entity as designated through the application.

### 3. Safeguards

3.1 Business Associate shall implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits, in accordance with the HIPAA Security Rule and any agreed standards.

3.2 Such safeguards shall include, at a minimum: (a) encryption of PHI in transit and at rest; (b) access controls so that only authorized individuals access PHI; (c) policies and procedures to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as permitted by this Agreement; and (d) no logging or retention of PHI in application or system logs beyond what is necessary for secure operation.

---

### 4. Reporting and Breach Notification

4.1 Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity, without unreasonable delay and in no event later than **[e.g., 60]** days after discovery, any use or disclosure of PHI not permitted by this Agreement, including any “breach” of unsecured PHI as defined in 45 C.F.R. § 164.402.

4.2 The report shall include, to the extent possible: (a) a description of what happened; (b) the types of PHI involved; (c) steps Business Associate is taking to mitigate harm and prevent recurrence; and (d) contact information for questions.

4.3 Business Associate shall cooperate with Covered Entity in meeting Covered Entity’s obligations to notify individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and others as required by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. Business Associate shall not notify individuals or the Secretary without Covered Entity’s prior written approval unless required by law.

### 5. Subcontractors and Agents

5.1 If Business Associate uses subcontractors or agents that will create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI, Business Associate shall ensure that each such subcontractor or agent agrees in writing to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to Business Associate under this Agreement with respect to such PHI.

5.2 Business Associate represents that its use of **[e.g., Amazon Web Services]** for hosting and related services is governed by a business associate agreement or equivalent terms acceptable under HIPAA.

---

### 6. Access, Amendment, and Accounting

6.1 To the extent PHI in Business Associate’s possession is maintained in a Designated Record Set, Business Associate shall make such PHI available to Covered Entity as necessary for Covered Entity to meet its obligations to provide individuals with access, amendment, and an accounting of disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

6.2 If an individual requests access, amendment, or an accounting directly from Business Associate, Business Associate shall forward the request to Covered Entity within **[e.g., 5]** business days and shall not respond directly except as directed by Covered Entity or as required by law.

---

### 7. Return or Destruction of PHI

7.1 Upon termination of this Agreement or upon Covered Entity’s written request, Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from or created or received on behalf of Covered Entity that Business Associate still maintains in any form. If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate shall extend the protections of this Agreement to such PHI and limit further use or disclosure to purposes that make return or destruction infeasible.

7.2 Business Associate shall complete return or destruction within **[e.g., 30]** days of termination or request and shall provide Covered Entity with written confirmation. Nothing in this section shall require Business Associate to return or destroy PHI that it is required to retain by law.

### 8. Term and Termination

8.1 This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue until terminated.

8.2 Either party may terminate this Agreement: (a) for material breach, upon **[e.g., 30]** days’ written notice if the breach is not cured; or (b) for convenience, upon **[e.g., 60]** days’ written notice.

8.3 Upon termination, the obligations in Sections 4, 6, and 7 shall survive. If Business Associate reasonably believes that return or destruction of PHI is not feasible, it shall notify Covered Entity and the provisions of Section 7.1 shall apply.

---

### 9. Miscellaneous

9.1 **Amendment.** This Agreement may be amended only in writing signed by both parties. To the extent that HIPAA or other applicable law is amended, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement as necessary to remain compliant.

9.2 **No Third-Party Beneficiaries.** Nothing in this Agreement confers any rights on any third party, including patients or plan members.

9.3 **Interpretation.** Any ambiguity shall be resolved to permit both parties to comply with HIPAA and applicable state law.
