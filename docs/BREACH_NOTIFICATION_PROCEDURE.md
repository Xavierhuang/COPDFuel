# Breach Notification Procedure (Internal)

**Purpose:** To assess suspected breaches of unsecured PHI and notify affected individuals and covered entities (practices) as required by HIPAA and your BAAs.

---

## 1. Roles

- **Privacy/Security contact:** [Name or role, e.g. "CTO" or "Privacy Officer"] – Responsible for assessing incidents and deciding whether a breach occurred and for coordinating notification.
- **Technical contact:** [Name or role] – Can investigate logs, access, and data exposure.

---

## 2. When to trigger this procedure

Trigger when:

- Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PHI is suspected (e.g. lost device, compromised credential, misconfigured access, ransomware, insider access).
- You are notified by a vendor (e.g. AWS) of a security incident that may involve your data.

---

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Contain and document (same day)

- Contain the issue (e.g. revoke access, fix misconfiguration).
- Document: date discovered, what happened, what data may have been involved, how it was discovered. Keep a written log (e.g. in a secure doc or ticket).

### Step 2: Assess (within a few days)

- **Privacy/Security contact** determines whether the incident is a "breach" under HIPAA (acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in an unpermitted way that compromises security or privacy). If uncertain, treat as breach or get legal advice.
- Document the assessment and the basis (breach vs. no breach).

### Step 3: Notify if breach

If it is a breach of **unsecured** PHI:

- **Affected individuals:** Notify each affected individual without unreasonable delay (HIPAA: generally within 60 days). Include: what happened, what data was involved, what they should do (e.g. monitor, change password), your contact for questions. Method: [e.g. email or first-class mail].
- **Covered entity (practice):** Notify each affected practice’s privacy/security contact as required by your BAA (often same 60-day standard). Provide enough detail for them to meet their own notification obligations.
- **HHS:** If 500+ individuals are affected, notify HHS (OCR) in the same time frame. If fewer, document and report annually if required. Consult legal counsel for exact requirements.
- **Media/state:** Consult legal counsel for any media or state-agency notification requirements (e.g. for large breaches).

### Step 4: Document and retain

- Keep a record of: the incident, assessment, notifications sent, and dates. Retain per your policy (e.g. 6 years).
- Update any internal post-incident review (root cause, corrective actions).

## 4. Practice contact list

Keep a secure list (e.g. encrypted or access-controlled) of each pilot practice’s breach/privacy contact:

| Practice name | Privacy/Security contact | Email | Phone |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------|--------|
| [Practice 1]  | [Name]                    | [ ]   | [ ]    |
| [Practice 2]  | [Name]                    | [ ]   | [ ]    |

Update when practices are added or contacts change.

## 5. Escalation

If the incident is serious (e.g. large number of records, ransomware, ongoing access), involve [e.g. legal counsel, cyber insurance] immediately.
