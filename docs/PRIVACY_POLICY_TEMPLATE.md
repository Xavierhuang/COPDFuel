## Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** [DATE]

### 1. Who we are

[Your company or app name], operating the COPD Health Tracker application ("we," "our," or "us").

### 2. What we collect

- **Account information:** Email address and password (managed by our identity provider). We do not store your password on our servers.
- **Health and tracking data:** Information you enter in the app, including weight, medications, oxygen readings, exercise, food and nutrition, and hydration. This may constitute Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA when shared with your healthcare provider.

### 3. How we use your information

- To provide the COPD Health Tracker app and its features.
- When you choose to link your account to a healthcare provider (e.g. your doctor or practice), we share your health data you have agreed to share with that provider for your care. We do this only after you give explicit consent in the app.

### 4. Where your data is stored

Your data is stored securely in the cloud using [AWS / Amazon Web Services], with encryption in transit (HTTPS) and encryption at rest. We use only services that support our compliance obligations.

### 5. Sharing of your information

We share your health data only with the healthcare practice(s) you explicitly link to in the app, and only after you consent. We do not sell your data. We do not use your health data for advertising or marketing. We may disclose information if required by law (e.g. court order or lawful process).

### 6. Security

We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption, access controls, and secure authentication. Only authorized users (you and, when you have linked, your chosen practice) can access your data. We require business associate agreements with practices that receive your data and with our infrastructure provider.

### 7. Your rights

You may request:

- **Access** – A copy of the personal and health data we hold about you.
- **Correction** – Correction of inaccurate data.
- **Deletion** – Deletion of your account and associated data, subject to any legal or contractual retention requirements.

To make a request, contact us at [your privacy contact email]. We will respond within [e.g. 30] days. If you have linked to a practice, you may also need to contact them for data they hold.

### 8. Data retention

We retain your data [e.g. while your account is active and for X years after your last activity, or until you request deletion, unless a longer period is required by law or our agreement with your healthcare provider]. When you request account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your data as described in our data retention and deletion policy, except where we must retain it by law.

### 9. Breach notification

If we discover a breach of your unsecured health information, we will notify you and any affected healthcare provider as required by applicable law, without unreasonable delay (generally within 60 days).

### 10. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy and, for material changes, we will notify you [e.g. by email or a notice in the app]. Your continued use of the app after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

### 11. Contact

For privacy questions, access/correction/deletion requests, or to report a concern:
